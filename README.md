# Overview
Simple binary CNN written in Verilog and implemented on FPGA.
Models were trained with PyTorch, only inference was hardwareized. 

* The purpose of this project is hardware implementation of neural network, and the accuracy of the model is not so good.

(I omitted the code for the VGA output part of the FPGA implementation.)
